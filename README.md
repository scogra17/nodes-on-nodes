# About 
Solution to nodes on nodes challenge. See additional notes in `./NOTES.md`

# Run
* cd into the root folder 
* run `node index.js`

# Solution
1. What is the total number of unique node IDs? `30` 
2. Which node ID is shared the most among all other nodes? `a06c90bf-e635-4812-992e-f7b1e2408a3f`

# Future work/optimizations
* Use the fact that the endpoint is able to handle multiple IDs to reduce the number of GET requests
